# Advent of Code 2020
First steps in Rust. I use 
VS Code with the extensions 
- CodeLLDB 
- Rust Test Lens
- rust-analyzer 

on  Windows 10.

# Current Results

To reproduce these results make sure to have Rust installed and run
```
python run.py
```
The results will be written into the `README.md`.
